## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VRVG1/404-not-found-page/main/Demo-page.gif)

I used the Astro framework to develop a custom 404 error page using reusable components.

Integration of Tailwind CSS: To streamline layout and create a responsive design, I chose to incorporate Tailwind CSS. This utility-first CSS framework allowed me to quickly design the 404 page without the need for extensive custom CSS. Moreover, Tailwind CSS provides a wide range of pre-defined classes that sped up the development process.
